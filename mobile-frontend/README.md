# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Push notifications on iOS

To receive push notifications in a development build you must supply your Firebase project ID. Create a `.env` file with `EXPO_PUBLIC_EAS_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>` (or set it in your build environment). The `GoogleService-Info.plist` file also needs to be included in the `ios` directory.

If the project ID is missing, `expo-notifications` will only return the APNs token, which Firebase cannot use. The console output from `initPushNotifications` shows the token type so you can verify that an FCM token was received.
